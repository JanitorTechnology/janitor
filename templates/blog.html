            <h2 class="header">Intent to Implement: Firefox IDE service <small title="Thu, 22 Jun 2017 16:37:35 UTC">June 2017</small></h2>
            <div><em>(This email was sent to Mozilla's <a href="https://lists.mozilla.org/listinfo/tools">tools</a> mailing list.)</em><br><br>Dear Firefox tooling community,<br><br><a href="https://janitor.technology">Janitor</a>, the zero setup, browser based development environment, has already made it easy for ~<a href="https://janitor.technology/data/">300</a> people to contribute to Firefox, Servo, Thunderbird, Chromium, KDE, Kresus and Janitor itself. It does this by eliminating the complexity that we have in setting up a development environment and reducing it down to a single click.<br><br>It uses <a href="https://c9.io/?redirect=0">Cloud9 IDE</a> + <a href="http://novnc.com">noVNC</a> as front-ends, and Docker containers as back-ends (here is a short <a href="https://youtu.be/5sNDMIh-iVw">video</a>). The environment <a href="https://github.com/JanitorTechnology/dockerfiles">images</a> are updated every day, and new containers are created on-demand from the <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/">website</a> in just a few seconds.<br><br>This gets new contributors making contributions that we care about more quickly: Instead of the minutes/hours/days usually needed to bootstrap these projects, it just takes <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/firefox/">2 seconds</a> to get a working environment.<br><br>Now we want to go even further by leveraging this platform to solve key software development issues encountered by more experienced Mozilla developers. Please help us by listing the problems that you encounter in your daily work in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/document/d/1KmIURMgpAPBi8Bkramo8ITr0fAH1f3XFYLl2hzv0s8M/edit">this document</a>.<br><br>To seed this discussion, we'll slightly abuse the &quot;Intent to Implement&quot; email format. Here goes.<br><br>== Summary ==<br><br>We want to build a &quot;Firefox IDE&quot; web service that automates the setup and maintenance of development environments for Firefox and Servo, providing containers that are quick to startup and that integrate the tools our developers need to produce high quality code without wasting time setting it all up.<br><br>Firefox IDE will provide a developer-friendly cloud environment that ties together:<br>- Services like Janitor, Bugzilla, Phabricator and TaskCluster (among others),<br>- Tools like gdb, rr, clang-tidy, eslint, clippy, ripgrep…,<br>- Code coverage and static analysis feedback, directly in the code editor.<br><br>This will help automate time-consuming Firefox development workflows, and will ease access to the most powerful Firefox tools &amp; services from a single location: an efficient IDE web front-end connected to auto-configured Docker containers.<br><br>Non-goal: We do not aim to replace local development setups with something new, but instead we wish to complement our current services offering with a developer service that brings live software development much closer to the Firefox CI infrastructure, and that offers convenient access to specific tools and workflows which might be harder to set up locally.<br><br>== Timeframe ==<br><br>We start by collecting key problems encountered by experienced Mozilla developers while working on Firefox and Servo in <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/document/d/1KmIURMgpAPBi8Bkramo8ITr0fAH1f3XFYLl2hzv0s8M/edit">this document</a>.<br><br>We will then work on solving the most compelling problems (with the highest estimated return on investment, based on feature interest and feasibility) and present a minimum viable &quot;Firefox IDE&quot; service to address the selected problems by the end of Q3.<br><br>After that, we hope to invite all Firefox and Servo developers to a Beta of this service; continue collecting feedback and address more problems from our list; and demo our solutions during the All Hands in Cancun.<br><br>== Tracking progress ==<br><br>Firefox and Servo development problems: <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/document/d/1KmIURMgpAPBi8Bkramo8ITr0fAH1f3XFYLl2hzv0s8M/edit">https://docs.google.com/a/mozilla.com/document/d/1KmIURMgpAPBi8Bkramo8ITr0fAH1f3XFYLl2hzv0s8M/edit</a><br>Repositories on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/JanitorTechnology/">https://github.com/JanitorTechnology/</a><br>Issues and milestones: <a href="https://github.com/JanitorTechnology/janitor/issues">https://github.com/JanitorTechnology/janitor/issues</a><br>IRC: #janitor on Freenode: <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#janitor">https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#janitor</a><br><br>Thanks!<br>Jan</div>

            <div>What better day to release <a href="https://janitor.technology" target="_blank">Janitor Alpha 0.0.7</a>&nbsp;and the new MOZ1&nbsp;backend server&nbsp;than on a <a href="https://www.estcequonmetenprodaujourdhui.info/" target="_blank">Friday</a>?<br><br><em>"All of these&nbsp;improvements should be live by the end of the week, and all new invite emails should be sent out by that time&nbsp;as well."</em></div><div style="text-align: right;">—<em>Famous last words from last week's <a href="https://janitor.technology/blog/" target="_blank">newsletter</a>.</em></div><div><br>1) How do I try this?<br><br>Simply log in to <a href="https://janitor.technology" target="_blank">janitor.technology</a>, click on any of the supported <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/" target="_blank">projects</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;start hacking.<br><br>If you don't have an account&nbsp;yet, the Alpha invite process is bit complicated (but we're working on making it much simpler). You will receive two emails:</div><div>- one&nbsp;to create a free <a href="https://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a> account (no credit card required),</div><div>- and another to access your Janitor account.</div><div><br>Please carefully read the steps in the "Janitor Invite" email, as they explain how&nbsp;to properly link Cloud9 IDE so that you can use it to hack on Firefox, Servo, Chromium, Thunderbird, KDE (and more projects coming soon) directly from Janitor. If you don't do it, it won't work.<br><br>2) New backend server!<br><br>The Janitor service now runs on two very powerful Docker servers:<br>- IRILL which is located in Paris,&nbsp;and will continue to host open source projects,<br>- MOZ1 which is located in California, and will host all Mozilla projects going forward.<br><br>MOZ1 is a brand new AWS EC2 instance sponsored by Mozilla,&nbsp;which has 16 CPUs,&nbsp;32GB&nbsp;RAM, 1TB disk space and that can build (from scratch):<br>- Servo in 08:27,<br>- Firefox in 11:10,<br>- Thunderbird in 12:19 (all clobber build times are from today).<br><br>The&nbsp;new project images also contain a few surprises for you:<br>- a&nbsp;Terminal prompt with colors, Git completions&nbsp;and a fancy branch indicator,<br>- cool scripts: `z` to navigate faster and `rg` to grep faster,<br>- the official `hub` script to interact with GitHub repositories,<br>- and a hidden feature as well (more about it soon).<br><br>MOZ1 is very recent (activated today)&nbsp;so if you started a Janitor <a href="https://janitor.technology/contributions/" target="_blank">contribution</a>&nbsp;before,&nbsp;chances are it's still hosted on IRILL. If you want to try the new, even faster MOZ1 server, you'll need to back up your work, delete your previous contribution (and its&nbsp;associated workspace on <a href="https://c9.io" target="_blank">Cloud9</a>)&nbsp;and click on any Mozilla project again. You'll then automatically land in a new Docker container hosted on MOZ1. (If Cloud9 doesn't work instantly, please wait a few seconds and refresh the page.)<br><br>A huge <strong>thank you</strong> to everyone who helped ship Janitor Alpha 0.0.7&nbsp;by writing&nbsp;code, reviewing code, solving problems, or finding more problems!

            <div><span>Happy 2017 everyone!</span><br>&nbsp;</div><div><span>This is your&nbsp;recurrent burst of good news about the&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/" target="_blank">Janitor</a>.</span><br><br>1) What's new in Janitor&nbsp;0.0.7?<br><br>We're about to release our biggest update yet, "Alpha: Mark 7". It took&nbsp;six months of dedicated efforts, touched&nbsp;almost every line of our code, and will greatly improve our ability to scale by adding more servers to what is now becoming a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing" target="_blank">distributed system</a>.<br><br>This means that our resource shortage is almost over, and that we'll finally be able to send out new invites&nbsp;(and also update all project images more frequently). We know that <a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">many</a>&nbsp;of you have been waiting to try the Janitor for months now, and&nbsp;we would like to acknowledge that and thank you for your patience. We hope you'll enjoy what we built for you.<br><br>Here is a list of changes made since&nbsp;Janitor 0.0.6 (released September 2016):<br><br>- Upgraded the Janitor source code to ECMAScript 6<br>- Updated all&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/dockerfiles" target="_blank">project images</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;latest sources and the greatest tools (clang 3.9, git 2.11, hg 3.7,&nbsp;vim 8, rust 1.15, node 7.5, rr 4.5, hub, rg, z,&nbsp;…)<br>- Implemented several important security features<br>- Implemented an OAuth2-based Single-Sign-On to work&nbsp;transparently across all Janitor hosts<br>- Started implementing a self-documenting and self-testing <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/blob/master/api/index.js" target="_blank">JSON API</a><br>- Implemented an <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/blob/master/lib/certificates.js" target="_blank">RSA helper</a> to generate certificates on the fly for SSH, Docker/TLS&nbsp;and HTTPS (automatically signed by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a>)<br>- Automated all server <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/blob/master/lib/boot.js" target="_blank">initialization&nbsp;tasks</a>, making most of the Makefile obsolete<br>- Automated all cluster-joining tasks in&nbsp;a separate <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/blob/master/join.js" target="_blank">helper script</a> (which will eventually allow adding your own servers with&nbsp;a single command&nbsp;and support your own projects on Janitor)<br><br>All of these&nbsp;improvements should be live by the end of the week, and all new invite emails should be sent out by that time&nbsp;as well.<br><br>2) Announcing Firefox IDE<br><br>Now that we've laid the foundation for a <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/servo/" target="_blank">fast</a>, powerful&nbsp;and ever-growing container service for developers, it's time for Janitor to enter a new phase.&nbsp;Now we would like&nbsp;to automate the development processes of&nbsp;every major open source project out there, starting with Firefox.<br><br>We plan to empower Firefox developers by integrating relevant tools, services and workflows directly in Janitor's IDE, in order to&nbsp;make them discoverable and easy to&nbsp;use, from a single&nbsp;web interface&nbsp;that can be accessed from anywhere instantly. Contrary to other, more general-purpose development tools, we aim to be highly specialized by implementing all the processes and best practices specific to the Firefox project.<br><br>We will start by building Cloud9 <a href="https://cloud9-sdk.readme.io/docs/create-a-package#section-the-plugin" target="_blank">plugins</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;update bugs on Bugzilla;&nbsp;trigger new jobs on TaskCluster; send contributions to Autoland;&nbsp;send push notifications about a patch's progress all the way from review, to automated tests, to finally being merged into the central repository;&nbsp;and augment&nbsp;the IDE's code editor with static analysis and automatic code quality&nbsp;suggestions based on amazing tools like <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/" target="_blank">clang-tidy</a>. You can participate in this process by reviewing, contributing or implementing&nbsp;ideas in&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/issues/30" target="_blank">this GitHub issue</a>.<br><br>And if this Firefox IDE&nbsp;experiment is successful, we will create similar IDEs for Servo, Rust, Chromium, Thunderbird, KDE, and all other open source projects that Janitor will support.<br><br><span>That's all Folks!&nbsp;</span>As always, previous newsletters can be found on our <a href="https://janitor.technology/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>, and&nbsp;if you have the time, please drop by to say hi in our very own <a href="https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/?#janitor" target="_blank">IRC channel</a>&nbsp;(on freenode).<br><br><span>Peace out,<br>Jan</span></div>

            <h2 class="header">Janitor News #6 <small title="Mon, 14 Nov 2016 15:51:00 UTC">November 2016</small></h2>
            <div><span>Hello,</span><br> </div><div><span>This is your monthly* burst of good news about the <a href="https://janitor.technology/" target="_blank">Janitor</a>.<br><br>* Well ok, this is actually more of a quarterly thing at the moment, but that doesn't mean nothing is happening—in fact quite the opposite is true. See for yourself:<br><br><br>1) Janitor & Mozilla's A-Team<br><br>In September, I officially joined Mozilla's <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/EngineeringProductivity" target="_blank">Engineering Productivity</a> team (also known as "A-Team") to help boost the productivity of developers working on Mozilla's software projects.<br><br>If this sounds like the Janitor to you, then you're spot on! In fact I'm now working full-time on improving the Janitor, with the support of some amazingly talented A-Team folks, and with the goal of making contributions to Mozilla's projects like Firefox, Servo and Rust (coming soon) much faster and easier for everyone.<br><br>And because Mozilla is awesome and a fierce supporter of Open Source in general, non-Mozilla projects like Chromium and KDE will continue to be supported, and we won't stop there—over the next months we'll continue adding more and more <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/issues/24" target="_blank">amazing projects</a> to the Janitor, like for example Git, Mercurial, Vim, Clang, and one day maybe even the Linux Kernel. The Janitor's long-term objective is to make open source contributions a breeze for everyone, anywhere in the world.<br><br><br>2) Say hello to Docker Host 2<br><br>Due to a swift increase in popularity over the last months, the Janitor's back-end resources became saturated much faster than expected. After a quick datacenter visit to install a new 1 TB drive on Docker Host 1 (which is now 98% full), we realized that adding more disks wouldn't help much longer.<br><br>So we re-designed the Janitor from the ground up and turned it into a multi-server cluster, which will allow the service to grow significantly over the coming months.<br><br>This is the Janitor cluster today:<br>- Docker Host 1 (16 CPU, 64 GB, 1 TB) hosted by <a href="https://www.irill.org/" target="_blank">IRILL</a> in a French datacenter,<br>- Docker Host 2 (16 CPU, 32 GB, 1 TB) hosted by <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> on an EC2 instance.<br><br>Everything is still hosted on Docker Host 1 (98% full), but all Mozilla projects (about half of the entire load) will be gradually and seamlessly migrated to Docker Host 2 soon. This will free up resources to support more users and projects, and will enable more frequent image updates as well as some overdue server maintenance.<br><br>We've also put special efforts into completely automating the addition of new hosts, from automatic <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/https/" target="_blank">TLS</a> and <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank">Let's Encrypt</a> certificates to cluster discovery and software updates, so that adding more resources becomes quick and easy. We could even make the cluster grow automatically following demand now.<br><br>If you're one of the <a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">almost 40</a> people still on the waitlist, we're so sorry to keep you waiting. We worked relentlessly on building a cluster with more resources, and we're happy to announce that the waiting is almost over—new invites should be headed your way over the coming weeks.<br><br><br>3) JSON API<br><br>A cool spin-off from the cluster effort is the <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/tree/master/api" target="_blank">JSON API</a> we designed to automate all things Janitor. It's based on <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/selfapi" target="_blank">Self API</a>, a system that can automatically document and test API functions against their own examples, removing the need to maintain separate documentation or test suites.<br><br>The resulting API documentation will soon be available on the <a href="https://janitor.technology" target="_blank">website</a>, and anyone interested in using it will be able to do so using the website's password-less authentication, or dedicated OAuth 2 access tokens.<br><br><br>4) Even more news<br><br>- On November 5, there was a <a href="https://www.coredump.ch/2016/11/06/rust-servo-hackathon/" target="_blank">Rust / Servo hackathon</a> with Janitor support at the </span><a href="https://www.coredump.ch/2016/06/06/wir-sind-umgezogen/" target="_blank">Coredump</a> hackerspace <span>in Zurich.<br>- On November 12, <a href="https://github.com/Coder206" target="_blank">Patrick Trottier</a> gave a great talk about open source contributions and the Janitor at <a href="https://devfest.gdgsudbury.ca/schedule/day1?sessionId=129" target="_blank">GDG DevFest</a> in Sudbury. Here are his <a href="http://slides.com/coder206/thejanitor#/" target="_blank">slides</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InQAJ4NNt18" target="_blank">video</a>.<br>- On December 7, I will present a few Janitor-based <a href="https://hawaiiallhands2016.sched.org/event/8s8O/developer-productivity-hacks" target="_blank">productivity hacks</a> at the Mozilla All Hands in Hawaii.<br>- We're currently evaluating how many contributions we've enabled. If you shipped code using the Janitor, please send us links to your contributions so we can count them.<br>- We recently published an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/janitor.technology" target="_blank">NPM module</a> which will eventually allow running private cluster hosts to support your own software projects on the Janitor (coming soon™).<br>- We would like to open a <a href="http://www.discourse.org/" target="_blank">Discourse</a>. If you know how that works and want to help, please reach out.<br><br>And this wraps up today's news! If you like to review code, you're welcome to pick a <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor/commits/master" target="_blank">Janitor commit</a> and post feedback on what you don't like or don't get about the code. Many thanks!<br><br>Until next time,<br>Jan</span></div>

            <h2 class="header">Janitor News #5 <small title="Fri, 26 Aug 2016 18:05:00 UTC">August 2016</small></h2>
            <div>Hello,<br> </div><div>We hope that you've enjoyed a hot and relaxing summer. It's time to resume your monthly burst of good news about <a href="https://janitor.technology" target="_blank">the Janitor</a>.<br> </div><div> </div><div>1) A New Order of Magnitude</div><div> </div><div>Earlier in June, the Janitor greeted its 100th user, and we're now growing fast into the three digits. Today, there are <a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">189</a> of us, and we've collectively landed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19YhJ_C4VhGtcvzezlhS6UEI5lJYl1LKl5nZwl6c1J-M/present#slide=id.g145d93b56e_0_105" target="_blank">31</a> official code contributions to the <a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/" target="_blank">5</a> supported software projects. Most of them went to Firefox, with Chrome a close second. (Note: If you've made a contribution using the Janitor, please tell me, they're hard to keep track of!)<br> </div><div>Thank you so much for all your enthusiasm and help. It's been an incredible journey so far, but the most exciting is what's yet to come.</div><div><br><br>2) What's Next<br> </div><div>At Mozilla we're currently in talks with Cloud9 to make their IDE even better for Firefox development. We'd love to build a dedicated <a href="https://ide.firefox.com" target="_blank">ide.firefox.com</a> service (domain pending) that would be accessible to any developer in just a single click. Then we'd like to expand this concept to other projects, with additional services like <a href="https://ide.servo.org" target="_blank">ide.servo.org</a> and <a href="https://ide.rust-lang.org" target="_blank">ide.rust-lang.org</a> (domains pending) that should all work seamlessly with the Janitor. And to support these at scale, we'll move your back-end Docker containers onto a more powerful cloud platform.<br> </div><div>Expect open source contributions to become ever easier with the Janitor, thanks to quick and intuitive UX integrations. For example, you should soon be able to send a patch for review directly from your IDE interface, or trigger an automated test run on your code, or even debug it step-by-step to look for bugs, and all these helpers will work simply with the click of a button.</div><div><br><br>3) Fixing Account Problems<br> </div><div>A few things have changed in the way Janitor Alpha accounts are set up. A separate Cloud9 account is still required, but it appears that Cloud9 asks for your credit card now, even for free accounts. I don't know why they chose to do this, but I'm sorry for that experience.<br> </div><div>If you're having trouble getting the Janitor to work, please make sure that you've added both your Cloud9 username and Cloud9 SSH public key to your Janitor <a href="https://janitor.technology/account/" target="_blank">account</a>. Adding your username will enable your Cloud9 account to work with the Janitor (this can take a short while, because I need to add you to our sponsored Team Account manually) while adding Cloud9's SSH public key will authorize their IDE to access your Janitor environments via SSH (without that, the IDE part won't work).</div><div><br> </div><div>4) Janitor Events</div><div> </div><div>Here is a recap of all Janitor-related events that happened since the last newsletter, or that will be coming soon.<br> </div><div>June 13-17, 2016: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/All_Hands/2016_London" target="_blank">Mozilla All Hands</a> in London<br>- I held two sessions where Mozillians could learn more about the Janitor. High five if you were there!<br>- Here are the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/19YhJ_C4VhGtcvzezlhS6UEI5lJYl1LKl5nZwl6c1J-M/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">slides</a> I presented.<br>- The room was not equipped for recording, but we shot a <a href="https://youtu.be/lOWt9-dB-Z4" target="_blank">video</a> anyway.<br> </div><div>August 27, 2016: <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Japan/Gecko_inside" target="_blank">Gecko Inside</a> in Tokyo<br>- During the next monthly community event at Mozilla Japan, there will be a Firefox Hackathon.<br>- Mantaroh will tell attendees about the Janitor, and anyone interested will be able to try it.<br> </div><div>October 28-30, 2016: <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/" target="_blank">MozFest</a> in London<br>- Each year, the Mozilla Festival is abuzz with exciting people and sessions.<br>- I offered to host a Firefox contribution workshop using the Janitor.<br>- I'll let you know if they accept.</div><div> </div><div>And that's it for today. If you missed any previous "Janitor News" email, they're now permanently available <a href="https://janitor.technology/blog/" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br><br>Stay tuned for more progress soon,<br>Jan</div>

            <div dir="ltr">Hi there,<div><br></div><div><div>Thanks a lot for being a pioneer in trying to change the way we do software development! The Janitor&#39;s alpha version is doing great, and things are already shaping up fast toward the beta.</div><div><br></div><div>It&#39;s very exciting to see this vision becoming reality, and you&#39;re making it happen. The Janitor currently has 31 confirmed users (15 on waitlist) and supports 6 large open source projects (<a href="https://janitor.technology/data/" target="_blank">source</a>).</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># Scaling to Multiple Servers</div><div><br></div><div>The back-end code is currently being rewritten to use the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/api/docker_remote_api/" target="_blank">Docker Remote API</a>. This will allow exciting improvements, like running multiple Docker servers in parallel, and more control for you on your&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/contributions/" target="_blank">contributions</a>.</div><div><br></div><div>Warning: I will do my best to make this transition seamless, but there is a slight risk of losing some containers in the process. <b>Please back up your work!</b></div><div><br></div><div><div><br></div><div><div># Project Dockerfiles</div><div><br></div><div>All the projects available on the Janitor have a&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/" target="_blank">Dockerfile</a>&nbsp;that describes a Linux environment suitable for their developers. Writing one is basically all it takes to add a new project to the Janitor. A few examples:</div><div><br></div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/dockerfiles/blob/master/firefox.docker" target="_blank">Firefox dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/firefox/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Ffirefox:latest">image size</a>.</div></div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/dockerfiles/blob/master/chromium.docker" target="_blank">Chrome dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/chromium/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Fchromium:latest">image size</a>.</div><div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/dockerfiles/blob/master/thunderbird.docker" target="_blank">Thunderbird dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/thunderbird/" target="_blank">build times</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://imagelayers.io/?images=janx%2Fthunderbird:latest">image size</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/dockerfiles/blob/master/servo.docker" target="_blank">Servo dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/servo/" target="_blank">build times</a>.</div><div>-&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/rcatolino/kdesrcbuild-docker/blob/master/kde.docker" target="_blank">KDE dockerfile</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href="https://janitor.technology/projects/kde/" target="_blank">build times</a>.</div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div># More Invites Coming Soon</div><div><br></div><div>Invites used to work like this: Users created a Cloud9 account, I asked Cloud9 to upgrade them to premium for free, and finally I sent out a Janitor invite. While this was great to get started quickly, it obviously doesn&#39;t scale. I&#39;m currently working with Cloud9 on a better solution that won&#39;t require premium accounts.</div><div><br></div><div>It goes without saying that the Janitor will always be <b>free for open source</b> contributors, but in the meantime if you already have a <a href="https://c9.io/pricing/webide">Cloud9 premium</a> account, please let me know (I can invite you right now).</div></div><div><div><div><br></div></div><div><br></div><div>That&#39;s it for today! If you have any question, or if you&#39;d like to help, please reach out. The Janitor is <a href="https://github.com/janitortechnology/janitor">on GitHub</a>, and we also have an <a href="https://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=janitor">IRC channel</a> on freenode.</div><div><br></div><div>Keep in touch,</div><div>Jan</div></div></div>
